| 游댮 | **[GKE support](#gke-support)** | Q1 2023 |

### Create repository and project
> This milestone is for setting up the repository and projects for cluster provsioning tool. This milestone will be done when 
> * The repository for cluster provisioning tool is setup.
> * The cluster provisioning tool container image is released.

Setting up the repository will allow us to manage the code for the cluster provisioning tool and enable us to colaborate and do code reviews. Releasing the container image for the tool will enable integration with LLM pipeline and other usages. Most of the goals of this milestone is prerequiste for making progress on the second milestone.

### Basic feature set release and LLM integration
> In this milestone we are targetting to create the MVP with basic functionality. This milestone will be done when
> * MVP for cluster provisioning tool is ready.
> * Public blogpost is released.

We will work on creating the MVP of cluster provisioning tool and work on integrating it with LLM pipeline. We will have the validations in place. We will release the container image for the tool as well.

### Advanced feature set for 16K support
> The target of this milestone is to integrate advanced features to cluster provisioning tool required for 16K GPU support. As we validate more scenarios for 16K GPU we will find additional goals required to support it. This milestone will be done when we have adequate support for 16K GPU in cluster provisioning tool.
